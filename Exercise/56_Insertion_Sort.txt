(* Insertion Sort algorithm is a bit more efficient sorting algorithm 
than Bubble Sort. As it name implies, the insertion sort algorithm 
inserts an unsorted item in an already sorted item list. This makes 
you think of the use of two seperated arrays - one unsorted and the 
other sorted. However, to save space one uses the same array and uses 
a pointer to separate the sorted and unsorted elements of the list.

The sorting time complexity of the Insertion Sort is O(n^2). Although 
this exactly the same to Bubble Sort's, the Insertion Sort algorithm 
is twice more efficient, yet inefficient for large lists. *)

Procedure InsertionSort(numbers : Array of Integer; size : Integer);
Var
	i, j, index : Integer;

Begin
	For i := 2 to size-1 do
	Begin
		index := numbers[i];
		j := i;
		While ((j > 1) AND (numbers[j-1] > index)) do
		Begin
			numbers[j] := numbers[j-1];
			j := j - 1;
		End;
		numbers[j] := index;
	End;
End.
