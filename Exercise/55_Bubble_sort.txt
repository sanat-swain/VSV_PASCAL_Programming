(* The Bubble Sort algorithm is simple, inefficient sorting algorithm. 
It is not recommended for use, since its performance at sorting a list 
of items is terribly slow. It is best at sorting a small list of items, 
but not for large ones.

The sorting time complexity of the Bubble Sort is O(n^2). *)

Procedure BubbleSort(numbers : Array of Integer; size : Integer);
Var
	i, j, temp : Integer;

Begin
	For i := size-1 DownTo 1 do
		For j := 2 to i do
			If (numbers[j-1] > numbers[j]) Then
			Begin
				temp := numbers[j-1];
				numbers[j-1] := numbers[j];
				numbers[j] := temp;
			End;
End.
